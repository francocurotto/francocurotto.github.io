Hi 👋 I'm Franco.

I'm an Electronics Engineer from  Chile 🇨🇱. I'm currently working as a Laboratoty Manager 👨‍🔬 in the research center [CATA](cata.cl). I'm also an emoji expert 😎🔥. 

In my free time I like to play video games 🎮, read about history 📜, and (very slowly) learn the Japanese language 🇯🇵.
